## _**Chapter 1 - On the scope of the criminal law**_


### **§ 1 - Crime committed in the Country**
 These laws apply to crimes committed in this Country.

### **§ 2 - Crime related to a Country’s vessel**
An offense committed on this Country’s vessel or aircraft is governed by the law if the offense has been committed:

1) when the vessel is on the high seas or in a non-State territory or when the aircraft is in or above such an area, or

2) when the vessel is in the territory of a foreign state or the aircraft is in or above such territory and the offense has been committed by the master of the ship or a member of its crew or its passenger or other person involved in the voyage.

This law also applies to an offense committed outside of this Country by a master of this Country’s vessel or aircraft or a member of its crew if the perpetrator has violated a special obligation belonging to him or her as a master of a vessel or a member of the crew by law.

### **§ 3 - Crime against this Nation**
This law applies to a crime committed outside this Country and committed against this Country.

The crime is considered to have been committed against this Country,

1) if it is an offense of treason or state treason,

2) if the act has otherwise seriously infringed or endangered the state, military or economic rights or benefits of this Country, or

3) if it has been directed at the Country’s authority.

### **§ 4 - Crime Scene**
The offense is deemed to have been committed both where the offense was committed and where the consequence according to the characteristics of the offense occurred. An offense of negligence is deemed to have been committed both where the perpetrator should have acted and where the consequence according to the characteristics of the offense occurred.

If the offense remained as an attempt, the offense is deemed to have been committed even if, when the offense had been committed, the consequence according to its characteristics would either have occurred or, in the perpetrator's opinion, would have occurred.

If there is no certainty about the place where the crime was committed, but there is reasonable reason to assume that the crime was committed in this Country, it is considered to have been committed in this Country.




## _**Chapter 2 - On penalties**_


### **§ 1 - Value of property**
If a penalty is to be imposed according to the value of a particular property; let the value of the property at the time the crime was committed be decisive.

### **§ 2 - Dismissal**
The dismissal referred to in the penal provisions of Chapters 9 and 10 of this Act shall include the loss of the office or public function in which the offense was committed. If an official has transferred from the post in which the offense was committed to another similar post, dismissal shall entail the loss of that post.

In the cases referred to in section 4 of this chapter, dismissal shall include the loss of the office and public function or the positions and public functions which the convicted person has at the time of sentencing.

### **§ 3 - Office**
An official, a person acting in a public position of trust or a person exercising public authority who is sentenced to life imprisonment shall also be sentenced to be removed from office. He shall also be sentenced to office if he is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of at least two years, unless the court finds that the offense does not render the convicted person unfit to be an official or to perform a public function.

If a person referred to in subsection 1 is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of less than two weeks for an intentional crime, he or she may at the same time be sentenced to dismissal from office if the crime shows him or her to be manifestly unfit to be an official or perform a public duty.

However, a member of the Public Assembly elected by universal suffrage shall not be convicted of that dismissal from office under this section.

### **§ 4 - Fines**
A convicted person who does not have the means to pay it in full shall, instead, be held in custody for the full amount of the fine; and the court shall, when sentencing fines, at the same time prescribe the period of imprisonment.

If the fine is converted into imprisonment, one days' imprisonment is equivalent to a fine of up to three hundred J-Bucks. If the fine rises above that of three thousand J-Bucks; Add to the punishment one day's imprisonment for every full five hundred J-Bucks; however, in no case shall the period of imprisonment be extended beyond twenty days.

### **§ 5 - Civic Confidence**
When a crime under the law results in a loss of civic confidence; be guilty of the consequences, distinguished from those rights and benefits which require a good reputation e.g. right to vote and hold office. If he holds a position or other general position; let it be lost.

Loss of civic confidence lasts for life, when the crime at the same time becomes imprisonment for life, or if otherwise specified in the section.

### **§ 6 - Military deprivation**
A person who is sentenced to imprisonment for a crime of treason or another offense for at least two weeks shall be sentenced to deprivation of military service.

However, the lowest military rank is not condemned to forfeiture.

### **§ 7 - Other punishments**
In a few cases, consequences other than those now mentioned can be used to punish the offense, depending on what is highly provided for in this law.


## _**Chapter 2 b - On imprisonment and combined punishment**_

### General provisions:

### **§ 1 - Content of imprisonment**
The content of a custodial sentence is the deprivation or restriction of liberty. The enforcement of a custodial sentence is regulated.

### **§ 2 - Length of imprisonment**
Imprisonment is imposed for a fixed term or for life.

A suspended custodial sentence shall be imposed for a minimum of one day and a maximum of 30 days.


### **§ 3 - Time units of imprisonment**
When sentenced to imprisonment, weeks, months and days are used as units of time. A sentence of less than three months shall be imposed in days. There are 365 days in a year and 30 days in a month.

### **§ 4 - Aggregation of prison sentences**
If a convicted person has to serve several temporary custodial sentences or combined custodial sentences at the same time, which do not constitute a joint custodial sentence, they shall be added together in prison.

Life imprisonment includes those custodial sentences, combined sentences, fine conversion sentences and detention orders that are enforced at the same time as life imprisonment.

### **Parole**

### **§ 5 - Definition and determination of parole**
Parole means allowing a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment sentence to serve the remainder of the sentence outside of prison.

Release to parole is possible after 1 day of imprisonment.

### **§ 6 - Supervised parole**
A prisoner may be placed outside the prison on probation supervised by technical means and in any other way not earlier than four days before his or her release.

### **§ 7 - Combined penalty**
When sentencing, the court may, at the request of the prosecutor, order that the accused be sentenced to a combined sentence consisting of a maximum term of imprisonment of up to 40 days.




## Chapter 3 - General conditions of criminal liability

### § 1 - Principle of legality
A committer of a crime may be held guilty only on the basis of an act which, at the time of the commission, is expressly provided for by law to be punishable.

Punishment and other criminal sanctions must be based on law.

### § 2 - Temporal applicability
The law in force at the time the offense was committed shall apply to the offense.

However, if a different law is in force at the time of conviction than at the time of the offense, the new law will apply if its application leads to a lesser outcome.

If the law is intended to be in force only for a specified period, the act in force at that time shall apply to the act committed during that period, unless otherwise provided.

If a criminal provision contained in a law derives its exact content from elsewhere in the law or provisions or regulations issued pursuant thereto, the punishment of the act shall be assessed on the basis of the provisions or regulations in force at the time of the act, unless otherwise provided by law or the new regulation

### § 3 - Criminality of negligence
Neglect is punishable if the offense so provides.

neglect is also punishable if the perpetrator has failed to prevent the consequence of the characteristic, even though he has had a specific legal obligation to prevent the consequence from occurring. Such an obligation may be based on:

1) to a position;

2) the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim;

3) for assignment or contract;

4) the perpetrator's hazardous activity; or

5) to another cause comparable to them.

### § 4 - Age of liability and fault
A perpetrator is innocent if, at the time of the act, he or she is unable to understand the actual nature or illegality of his or her act due to mental illness, profound disability or serious mental or unconsciousness, or his ability to regulate his behavior is decisively impaired.

If the perpetrator is not guilty according to subsection 1, but his ability to understand the actual nature or illegality of his act or to regulate his behavior is significantly impaired at the time of the act due to mental illness, disability or mental or unconsciousness (reduced guilt): subsections 2 and 3 provide.

Intoxication or other temporary disturbance of consciousness caused by the perpetrator shall not be taken into account in the assessment of guilt unless there are particularly compelling reasons to do so.

If a court fails to punish a person accused of a crime due to his or her state of mind, the court shall, unless it is manifestly unnecessary, refer the matter to his or her need for treatment.

### § 5 - Imputability
Intentional or negligence is a precondition for criminal liability.

Unless otherwise provided, an act referred to in this Act shall be punishable only intentionally.

What is provided in subsection 2 also applies to an act referred to elsewhere in the Act, the most severe punishment of which is more than 30 days' imprisonment or for which a penalty provision has been issued after the entry into force of this Act.

### § 6 - Intent
An author has intentionally caused a consequence in accordance with the characteristics if he has intended to cause a consequence or considered the consequence to be certain or quite probable. A consequence is also caused intentionally if the perpetrator has considered it to be certainly related to the intended consequence.



## Chapter 4 - Discharge criteria

### § 1 - Characteristic error
If, at the time of the act, the perpetrator is not aware of the presence of all the facts necessary for the realization of the characteristics of the offense, or if he is mistaken about such a fact, the act is not intentional. However, liability for a criminal offense may be raised under the provisions on the criminalization of negligence.

### § 2 - Prohibition error
If the perpetrator makes a mistake in thinking his act as lawful, he shall be free from criminal liability if the mistake is to be regarded as manifestly excusable for the following reasons:

1) incomplete or incorrect publication of the law;

2) the special ambiguity of the content of the law;

3) incorrect advice from the authority; or

4) any other factor comparable to these.

### § 3 - Error in the exculpatory case
If the act does not involve a ground of discharge referred to in sections 4 to 6 below, but the act, as the author rightly understood it, was related to such a ground, he shall not be punished for an intentional crime. However, liability for negligent offenses may arise under the provisions on the criminalization of negligence.

### § 4 - Self defence
A defensive action necessary to counter an unlawful attack initiated or imminently threatened is permitted as self defence, unless the action clearly appears to be considered as a whole to be defended, taking into account the nature and intensity of the attack, the person defending and attacking and other circumstances.

However, if the defense exceeds the limits of self defence (exaggeration of self defence), the perpetrator is free from criminal liability if the circumstances were such that the perpetrator could not reasonably have been required to take a different approach, given the danger and surprise of the attack and the situation anyway.

### § 5 - Force
An act necessary to combat an immediate and compelling threat to a legally protected interest other than that referred to in section 4 above is permissible as a compulsive act if the act as a whole must be defended, taking into account the nature and extent of the rescue and damage conditions.

However, if an act committed to save a legally protected interest is not deemed permissible on the basis of subsection 1, the perpetrator shall be free from criminal liability if the perpetrator could not reasonably have been required to take a different approach, taking into account the importance of the interest to be salvaged.

### § 6 - Use of force
The right to use force in the performance of official duties or for other similar reasons, as well as the right to assist persons appointed to maintain order, shall be provided for separately by law.

When using force, recourse shall be had only to such measures as are necessary to carry out the task and must be considered defensible as a whole, having regard to the importance and urgency of the task, the danger of resistance and the situation in any case.

However, if the limits laid down in subsection 2 have been exceeded in the use of force, the perpetrator shall be free from criminal liability if there are very compelling reasons to believe that the perpetrator could not reasonably have been required to take a different approach.

### § 7 - Mitigation of criminal liability
Although the perpetrator is not fully released from criminal liability on the basis of the criteria set out in this chapter, the circumstances may nevertheless be taken into account as mitigating criminal liability.



## Chapter 5 - About attempt and inclusion

### § 1 - Attempt
An attempt to commit a crime is punishable only if the attempt is punishable under a provision on intentional crime.

An act has progressed into an attempt to commit a crime when the perpetrator has begun to commit the crime and created a danger of the crime being committed. Attempt to commit a crime is a crime even when there is no such danger, if the non-occurrence of the danger was due to only occasional reasons.

### § 2 - Abandonment and effective repentance
An attempt shall not be penalized if the perpetrator has voluntarily waived the commission of the offense or otherwise prevented the occurrence of the consequence referred to in the characteristics.

Where there are several parties to the offense, abandonment and effective repentance shall release the perpetrator, instigator or facilitator from liability only if he or she has also persuaded the other parties to refrain from committing the offense or otherwise prevented his or her conduct or

In addition to the provisions of subsections 1 and 2, an undertaking shall not be penalized if the offense is not committed or the consequence referred to in the characteristics does not occur for reasons beyond the control of the perpetrator, instigator or donor, but has voluntarily and seriously sought to prevent the offense or consequence.

If an undertaking which does not go unpunished under subsections 1 to 3 simultaneously commits another committed offense, that offense shall be punished.

### § 3 - Criminal partnership
If two or more have committed an intentional crime together, each is punished as the perpetrator.

### § 4 - Indirect action
A perpetrator is a person who has committed an intentional crime by using another person as an intermediary, who cannot be punished for that crime due to innocence or lack of intent, or for any other reason related to the conditions of criminal liability.

### § 5 - Incitement
Anyone who intentionally incites another to an intentional crime or an attempt to punish it is convicted of incitement to commit a crime like the perpetrator.

### § 6 - Assistance
Any person who, before or during an offense, by counsel, action or otherwise intentionally assisting another to commit an intentional offense or an attempt to punish it shall be convicted of aiding and abetting under the same law as the perpetrator.

Incitement to punishable aid is punishable as aid.

### § 7 - Special personal circumstances
A special circumstance relating to a person which removes, reduces or increases the impunity of an act applies only to the perpetrator, instigator or donor in that relation.

An instigator or accomplice shall not be relieved of criminal liability by the fact that he or she is not subject to a special personal circumstance which justifies the perpetrator's act.

### § 8 - Acting on behalf of a legal person
A member of the statutory body or management of the entity, foundation or other legal person, and those conditions are met.

If the offense has been committed in an organized activity belonging to the trader's business or in another organized activity equivalent to the activity of a legal person, the provisions of subsection (1) concerning an offense committed in the activity of a legal person shall apply correspondingly.

The provisions of this section shall not apply unless otherwise provided by law elsewhere.



## Chapter 6 - Imposing a penalty

### General provisions:


### § 1 - Types of penalties
Common types of punishment include fines, parole, community service, supervision punishment, loss of civic confidence and unconditional imprisonment.

Specific penalties for officials include warning and dismissal.

### § 2 - Penalty scale and deviation from it
The penalty is determined in accordance with the scale of penalties provided for the offense. It may be derogated from as provided in sections 8 and 8a. The maximum penalty on the scale may also be exceeded when sentenced to a joint penalty as provided in Chapter 7.

### § 3 - Basis for imposing a penalty
When imposing a sentence, all the criteria affecting the amount and type of the sentence and the uniformity of the penal practice must be taken into account.

The criteria affecting the measurement of punishment are the criteria mentioned in sections 4–8 of this chapter in addition to those provided elsewhere in the law.

When deciding on the type of punishment, in addition to the criteria affecting the measurement of the punishment, the provisions of sections 9–12 shall be observed.

Measuring punishment:

### § 4 - General principle
The punishment shall be measured in such a way that it is proportionate to the harmfulness and danger of the offense, the motives for the act and the other guilt of the perpetrator.

### § 5 - Criteria for aggravation
The grounds for aggravation are:

1) the systematic nature of criminal activities;

2) committing a crime as part of the activities of an organized criminal group;

3) committing an offense against remuneration;

4) the commission of an offense based on race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, religion or belief, sexual orientation or disability, or any other similar factor; and

5) the perpetrator's previous crime, if the relationship between it and the new offense due to the similarity of the offenses or otherwise shows the perpetrator's obvious disregard for the prohibitions and orders of the law.

An organized criminal group is a consortium of at least three persons with a structured structure for a certain period of time, acting together to commit offenses.

### § 6 - Mitigation criteria
The criteria for mitigating the penalty are:

1) significant pressure, threat or similar circumstance that contributed to the commission of the crime;

2) strong human compassion or exceptional and unforeseeable temptation, exceptionally high involvement of the person concerned or any other similar circumstance which has led to a weakening of the perpetrator's ability to comply with the law;

3) the reconciliation reached between the perpetrator and the person concerned, any other attempt by the perpetrator to prevent or eliminate the effects of his or her crime or his or her efforts to promote the investigation of his or her crime; and

4) the grounds mentioned in section 8, subsections 1 and 3.

### § 7 - Grounds for justification
In addition to the provisions of section 6 above, the mitigating factor must also be taken into account

1) other consequences for the perpetrator caused by the criminal offense or a judgment,

2) the author 's advanced age, poor health or other personal conditions; and

3) a considerable period of time has elapsed since the commission of the offense,

if, for these reasons, a penalty in accordance with established practice would lead to an unreasonable or exceptionally harmful outcome.

### § 8 - Reduction of the penalty scale
The penalty shall be determined according to a reduced scale of penalties if:

1) the crime has remained as an attempt;

2) the perpetrator is convicted as an assistant in a crime by applying the provisions of Chapter 5, Section 6, or his or her involvement in the crime is otherwise clearly less than the involvement of others;

3) the offense was committed in circumstances closely resembling those leading to the application of the grounds for discharge; or

4) there are special reasons for it mentioned in section 6 or 7 above or on other exceptional grounds mentioned in the judgment.

When imposing a punishment under subsection 1, the perpetrator may be sentenced to a maximum of three-fourths of the maximum amount of imprisonment or fine imposed for the offense and at least the minimum amount of the type of punishment provided for the offense. If the offense could result in life imprisonment, the maximum penalty instead is 30 days in prison and the minimum penalty is 7 days in prison.

If the offense is punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment, the court may, in the cases referred to in this section, impose a fine instead of imprisonment if there are particularly compelling reasons for doing so.

### Choice of penalty type:

### § 9 - Choice between conditional and unconditional imprisonment
A term of imprisonment of up to 14 days may be imposed on probation (conditional imprisonment) unless the seriousness of the offense, the perpetrator's guilt or the offender's previous criminal offense require absolute imprisonment.

### § 10 - Consequences of parole
If parole is to be considered an insufficient punishment for a crime, it may be accompanied by a fine, or if parole is 14 days or more, a minimum of 14 and a maximum of 120 hours of community service.

### § 11 - Community service
An offender who is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of up to 14 days shall be sentenced instead to community service, unless absolute custodial sentences, supervision sentences, previous community service sentences, continued criminal activity or other compelling reasons.

A condition for sentencing to community service is that the offender has given his or her consent to be sentenced to community service and that he or she can be presumed to perform community service.

### § 12 - Non - conviction
The court may not sentence the sentence if:

1) the offense is regarded as insignificant in relation to its harmfulness or the guilt of the perpetrator arising therefrom;

2) the offense is equated with an excusable act for special reasons related to the act or the perpetrator;

3) the punishment shall be deemed unreasonable, especially taking into account the circumstances referred to in section 6 (3) and section 7 above or social and health care measures; or

4) the offense would not materially affect the amount of the total sentence as a result of the provisions on the imposition of a common penalty.

## Chapter 7 - On the joint punishment

### § 1 - Sentencing
In cases where a person would be sentenced to imprisonment for two or more offenses, he shall be sentenced to a joint punishment of imprisonment, unless otherwise provided elsewhere in law. 

In cases where one offence would be punished by imprisonment and two or more other offenses by a fine, the court can pass a joint sentence of imprisonment for all the offenses or a joint sentence of imprisonment for some of the offenses and, in addition, a fine for the other offenses. 

If an offence would be punished by imprisonment for life, a sentence of imprisonment for life is passed as a joint punishment for all the offenses.

### § 2 - Maximum and minimum period of imprisonment
When sentencing to a joint punishment, the maximum penalties for the various offenses can be exceeded, but the sentence shall not be longer than the sum total of the maximum penalties of the various offenses. In addition, the most severe maximum penalty cannot be exceeded by more than

1) 4 days if the maximum penalty is less than 7 days' imprisonment;

2) 7 days if the maximum penalty is imprisonment for at least 5 days but less than 14 days; and not

3) 10 days, if the maximum penalty is imprisonment for a term of at least 14 days.

The sentence shall not be shorter than the most severe minimum penalty for the various offenses. 
 
The most severe maximum and minimum penalty means the sentence that, according to the provisions to be applied in the case, can be passed as the maximum and minimum penalty. If one or more offenses are punishable only by a fine, the fines altogether shall be considered to equal one month's imprisonment when calculating the sum total of the maximum penalties of the various offenses.

### § 3 - Joint fine
If a person should be sentenced at the same time to fines for two or more offenses, he shall instead be sentenced to a joint fine. The maximum for a joint fine is 50% of the total wealth of the preptator.

### § 3a - Fine and penalty
If the fine or joint fine would be lower than the total amount of the fine or the most severe fine, the fine or joint fine shall be increased to the amount of the fine or the most severe fine before the increase.

### § 4 - Other sanctions
If an offense is punishable by dismissal or other sanction in addition to the general punishment, the sanction shall also be imposed in addition to the joint punishment under the conditions provided by law.

### § 5 - Measuring main punishment
The provisions of Chapter 6 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the measurement of joint custodial sentences and fines.

The starting point for measuring a main penalty shall be the penalty for the offense which the court considers should be the most severe, and the main penalty for the offenses shall be measured in a way that is proportionate to the number, seriousness and interrelationship of the offenses. If any of the grounds for aggravating or mitigating a sentence referred to in Chapter 6, or any other factor mentioned in that Chapter, relates only to one or more of the offenses to be convicted at the same time, it shall be reasonably taken into account when measuring the joint sentence.

### § 6 - Taking into account a previous conviction or a combined sentence.
If a person sentenced to an absolute custodial sentence or a combined custodial sentence is charged with another offense committed before his or her sentence, the previous absolute custodial sentence or combined custodial sentence may reasonably be taken into account as a mitigating or mitigating factor in imposing a new sentence. A new offense may also be punishable by a term of imprisonment shorter than the minimum period prescribed by law, or an earlier punishment may also be considered a sufficient sanction for an offense to be tried later.

The judgment shall state which previous judgment or judgments have been taken into account in measuring the sentence under this section.
